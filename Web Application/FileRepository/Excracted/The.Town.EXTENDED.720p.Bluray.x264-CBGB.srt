Three hundred and seventy

More per capita than
anywhere else in the world.

90 percent of them...

1223
01:27:25,775 --> 01:27:27,322
Look familiar?

1224
01:27:29,987 --> 01:27:32,536
You opened the safe for him.

1225
01:27:33,282 --> 01:27:35,705
He left you unharmed...

1226
01:27:35,868 --> 01:27:40,920
...and now the two of you are carrying on a
relationship about which you lied to the FBI.

1227
01:27:41,082 --> 01:27:42,174
I was wrong.

1228
01:27:43,167 --> 01:27:45,044
You do need a lawyer.

1229
01:27:53,052 --> 01:27:54,679
DOUG:
Something wrong with the apartment?

1230
01:27:54,845 --> 01:27:57,064
JEM:
No, Florist.

1231
01:27:57,974 --> 01:27:59,146
Florist? What?

1232
01:27:59,308 --> 01:28:00,810
Came through.

1233
01:28:01,268 --> 01:28:04,568
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-it's large, Dougy.

1234
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:06,903
-it's large.
-We're smoked. Punt it.

1235
01:28:07,233 --> 01:28:10,203
-Who else is gonna buy it?
-You should've thought about that...

1236
01:28:10,361 --> 01:28:12,955
,..before you kept breaking the guy off
for 40 dimes.

1237
01:28:13,114 --> 01:28:15,458
-There's an expectation for me.
-I'll correct it.

1238
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:19,246
-Oh, you will? Okay.
-Yeah. Look.

1239
01:28:19,412 --> 01:28:24,589
Look, pick up an extra guy. All right?
Or go with three guys.

1240
01:28:24,834 --> 01:28:27,087
Or fucking be smart and boot it.

1241
01:28:27,253 --> 01:28:29,221
Oh, so you're not going?

1242
01:28:30,381 --> 01:28:31,633
No.

1243
01:28:33,426 --> 01:28:34,848
And why's that?

1244
01:28:35,011 --> 01:28:37,355
Because we got a ton of heat on us,
for one thing.

1245
01:28:37,513 --> 01:28:39,936
We'll put a move on.
We've done it a hundred times.

1246
01:28:40,099 --> 01:28:43,148
You know what? Forget it.
Do what you want to do. I'm done.

1247
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:44,937
-What? What?
-I'm done.

1248
01:28:45,104 --> 01:28:47,448
-You're done?
-What does it sound like?

1249
01:28:47,606 --> 01:28:50,280
-I don't know. What's that mean?
-What you think it means?

1250
01:28:50,443 --> 01:28:52,912
What does that mean?
Sounds like a bunch of bullshit.

1251
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:56,950
Let me put it to you this way: I'm putting
this whole fucking town in my rear-view.

1252
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:01,788
There's people I can't let you
walk away from.

1253
01:29:03,247 --> 01:29:04,464
What?

1254
01:29:05,249 --> 01:29:06,626
Who?

1255
01:29:08,252 --> 01:29:09,674
Come on.

1256
01:29:12,465 --> 01:29:14,593
Are you serious, Jimmy?

1257
01:29:15,301 --> 01:29:16,803
She's not my kid.

1258
01:29:21,807 --> 01:29:24,026
I mean, come the f-- Cut it out.

1259
01:29:24,185 --> 01:29:26,279
All you give a fuck about
is coke and Xbox...

1260
01:29:26,437 --> 01:29:29,316
,..now you're trying to play it off
like you care about Shyne?

1261
01:29:29,482 --> 01:29:32,361
Know what your problem is?
You think you're better than people.

1262
01:29:32,526 --> 01:29:35,200
Mr. Fucking-Clean.
Mr. Fucking-Goddamn-High-and-Mighty.

1263
01:29:35,362 --> 01:29:38,115
I'm better than all these people.
I'm better than everybody.

1264
01:29:38,282 --> 01:29:40,535
But you grew up right here.

1265
01:29:41,118 --> 01:29:43,212
Same rules that I did.

1266
01:29:43,746 --> 01:29:45,043
Okay.

1267
01:29:45,498 --> 01:29:47,045
What else?

1268
01:29:49,168 --> 01:29:50,670
Who the fuck's the father?

1269
01:29:51,879 --> 01:29:54,007
-I know I'm not.
-You were the one fucking her.

1270
01:29:54,173 --> 01:29:56,426
Yeah, I wasn't the only one, brother.

1271
01:29:56,675 --> 01:29:58,894
Okay? She knew
l knew I'm not the father...

1272
01:29:59,053 --> 01:30:01,647
,..and I have enough respect for her
not to ask her.

1273
01:30:01,806 --> 01:30:03,524
Because I don't think she knows.

1274
01:30:03,682 --> 01:30:06,526
I don't wanna shatter
your illusions here, partner.

1275
01:30:06,685 --> 01:30:08,813
There aren't enough free clinics
in Mattapan...

1276
01:30:08,979 --> 01:30:11,573
,..to ind out who the father
of that kid is.

1277
01:30:12,108 --> 01:30:14,577
I don't know who the fuck
you think you are either.

1278
01:30:15,236 --> 01:30:17,955
You aren't letting me
or not letting me do shit, all right?

1279
01:30:18,114 --> 01:30:19,787
Here's a little cheat sheet for you.

1280
01:30:19,949 --> 01:30:23,044
It's never gonna be me and you
and your sister and Shyne...

1281
01:30:23,202 --> 01:30:24,795
,..fucking playing house up there.

1282
01:30:24,954 --> 01:30:28,254
All right? You got it?
Get that in your fucking head!

1283
01:30:28,415 --> 01:30:31,419
I'm tired of your one-way
fucking bullshit.

1284
01:30:31,585 --> 01:30:35,715
If you wanna see me again,
come down and visit me in Florida.

1285
01:30:41,595 --> 01:30:42,642
JEM:
Cunt.

1286
01:31:10,916 --> 01:31:12,839
In the 302,..

1287
01:31:13,627 --> 01:31:16,301
,..feds have me dropping Brendan
right here.

1288
01:31:17,882 --> 01:31:20,180
I got him back on Tibbetts.

1289
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,762
Shot him right in the chest.

1290
01:31:25,264 --> 01:31:26,607
I remember he looked at me.

1291
01:31:26,765 --> 01:31:30,269
I don't know who was more fucking
surprised he wasn't dead, him or me.

1292
01:31:30,603 --> 01:31:32,605
We just kind of stood there...

1293
01:31:33,272 --> 01:31:36,742
,..for a second, like, waiting for some
shit to happen. I don't know what.

1294
01:31:37,943 --> 01:31:39,616
He started running.

1295
01:31:40,112 --> 01:31:43,082
Fucking guy ran 100 yards
with a bullet in his heart, Dougy.

1296
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:47,370
I mean, the fucking guy should've ran track.
You know what I'm saying?

1297
01:31:51,457 --> 01:31:52,834
I didn't ask you to do that.

1298
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,128
Yeah, well, you didn't have to, Dougy.
Come on.

1299
01:31:55,794 --> 01:31:59,719
They told me Brendan was coming down
here to roll up on you with a Glock 21,

1300
01:31:59,882 --> 01:32:02,852
So I came over here,
and I put him in the fucking ground.

1301
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,438
Did nine years for it.

1302
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:10,142
Now, you don't gotta thank me...

1303
01:32:10,851 --> 01:32:12,649
,..but you're not walking away.

1304
01:32:14,813 --> 01:32:17,657
I'm grateful for everything you done
for me.

1305
01:32:18,943 --> 01:32:21,913
Your family took me in
when my father went away.

1306
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:26,583
You're like a brother to me.

1307
01:32:28,327 --> 01:32:30,000
But I'm leaving.

1308
01:32:32,831 --> 01:32:34,458
Gonna shoot me?

1309
01:32:35,668 --> 01:32:37,170
Go ahead.

1310
01:32:38,462 --> 01:32:40,885
But you're gonna have to shoot me
in the back.

1311
01:32:53,102 --> 01:32:55,025
-Don't get up.
-All right.

1312
01:32:55,187 --> 01:32:56,985
How you doing, Fergie?

1313
01:32:57,147 --> 01:33:00,947
Listen, just wanted to stop by
and tell you myself...

1314
01:33:01,694 --> 01:33:04,447
...whatever this thing is you got
going on...

1315
01:33:04,613 --> 01:33:07,708
...I think my guys can handle it
without me. You know what I mean?

1316
01:33:07,866 --> 01:33:09,868
I wouldn't hire them without you.

1317
01:33:10,035 --> 01:33:11,958
And I wouldn't hire you without them.

1318
01:33:12,121 --> 01:33:13,373
You're a unit.

1319
01:33:13,539 --> 01:33:17,339
Look, with all due respect,
I didn't come here for a debate.

1320
01:33:17,876 --> 01:33:19,549
I'm not doing it.

1321
01:33:19,795 --> 01:33:23,675
So, you know, work it out
however you can. I ....

1322
01:33:23,841 --> 01:33:26,640
Calm down. Okay?

1323
01:33:26,802 --> 01:33:29,726
It goes against
my better judgment...

1324
01:33:30,431 --> 01:33:33,560
,..but just out of respect,
smooth things over...

1325
01:33:34,059 --> 01:33:36,357
,..just take this for it, all right?

1326
01:33:36,937 --> 01:33:38,029
Not gonna cut it.

1327
01:33:38,731 --> 01:33:41,735
Do you think I'm gonna put
Joe Flipperhead on this?

1328
01:33:42,234 --> 01:33:44,202
You're gonna do what I ask.

1329
01:33:44,361 --> 01:33:45,578
DOUG:
Not gonna cut it, huh?

1330
01:33:48,157 --> 01:33:49,409
Okay.

1331
01:33:49,575 --> 01:33:52,670
Let me ask you something.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

1332
01:33:53,078 --> 01:33:55,172
The only guy in Charlestown
with a gun?

1333
01:33:55,581 --> 01:33:57,504
You guys run numbers and pump dope.

1334
01:33:57,666 --> 01:34:00,761
You're an old guy who don't know
his glory years are behind him.

1335
01:34:00,919 --> 01:34:03,923
I ain't fucking working for you.
Got it?

1336
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:09,016
You got a problem with that, I live at
551 Bunker Hill Street. Stop by anytime.

1337
01:34:09,178 --> 01:34:10,896
You know where to find me.

1338
01:34:11,513 --> 01:34:13,561
You're gonna do this for me,..

1339
01:34:13,724 --> 01:34:16,102
,..or I'm gonna clip your nuts...

1340
01:34:16,435 --> 01:34:17,903
,..like I clipped your daddy's.

1341
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,067
Don't talk about my father.

1342
01:34:20,230 --> 01:34:22,779
Son, I knew your daddy.

1343
01:34:22,941 --> 01:34:25,865
He worked for me for years. Years.

1344
01:34:26,403 --> 01:34:28,497
Then he wanted his own thing.

1345
01:34:31,241 --> 01:34:32,288
You play the horses?

1346
01:34:34,078 --> 01:34:38,834
You know, they either geld a horse
with a knife...

1347
01:34:38,999 --> 01:34:40,967
,..or with the chemicals.

1348
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:43,554
When your daddy said no to me...

1349
01:34:44,004 --> 01:34:45,972
,..l did him the chemical way.

1350
01:34:46,548 --> 01:34:48,300
Gave your mother a taste.

1351
01:34:48,467 --> 01:34:50,094
Put the hook into her.

1352
01:34:50,469 --> 01:34:52,813
She doped up good and proper.

1353
01:34:53,597 --> 01:34:56,396
Hung herself with a wire
on Melnea Cass.

1354
01:34:57,017 --> 01:34:59,941
And you? Running around
the neighborhood, looking for her.

1355
01:35:00,813 --> 01:35:03,157
Your daddy didn't have the heart
to tell his son...

1356
01:35:03,315 --> 01:35:06,489
,..that he was looking for a suicide doper
who was never coming home.

1357
01:35:07,903 --> 01:35:11,282
If there's a heaven, son,
she ain't in it.

1358
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:17,667
Oh.

1359
01:35:19,832 --> 01:35:22,255
I hear you got a nice,
sweet new girlfriend.

1360
01:35:22,418 --> 01:35:23,965
Lives on the park.

1361
01:35:24,753 --> 01:35:27,848
I don't want to send her
funeral arrangement to your house...

1362
01:35:28,715 --> 01:35:30,558
,..but I will if I have to.

1363
01:35:31,552 --> 01:35:33,600
Now I know where to ind you.

1364
01:35:35,389 --> 01:35:36,857
DOUG:
Claire.

1365
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:39,477
Claire?

1366
01:35:51,155 --> 01:35:52,372
-Hey.
-Get out.

1367
01:35:52,531 --> 01:35:53,703
You okay?

1368
01:35:54,450 --> 01:35:56,873
-Get out.
-Hold on one second.

1369
01:35:57,035 --> 01:35:58,537
I have this on 911.

1370
01:35:58,704 --> 01:36:01,878
All right, you need to give me a chance
to explain myself first. Okay?

1371
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:03,132
No. You had a chance.

1372
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:06,007
Who talked to you?

1373
01:36:07,463 --> 01:36:09,716
The FBI, Doug.

1374
01:36:11,967 --> 01:36:13,890

,..then I guess that's what I'll do. Yeah.

1840
02:17:16,012 --> 02:17:17,184
Okay.

1841
02:17:18,681 --> 02:17:21,480
Claire, listen, I'm--
Listen. Listen to me.

1842
02:17:23,645 --> 02:17:25,147
I'm sorry, okay?

1843
02:17:26,564 --> 02:17:28,783
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

1844
02:17:30,193 --> 02:17:31,536
Remember that.

1845
02:17:32,236 --> 02:17:35,206
Come down in the back
and let me in in about an hour:

1846
02:17:38,034 --> 02:17:39,502
All right?

1847
02:17:41,371 --> 02:17:42,998
I'll see you.

1848
02:17:44,415 --> 02:17:46,213
Wait, Doug? Doug?

1849
02:17:47,335 --> 02:17:48,803
-Yeah.
-I want you to come.

1850
02:17:48,962 --> 02:17:51,886
I really wanna see you.

1851
02:17:56,594 --> 02:17:59,564
It'll be just like one of my sunny days.

1852
02:18:11,859 --> 02:18:13,076
Well...

1853
02:18:15,238 --> 02:18:16,911
,..I'm on my way then.

1854
02:18:19,742 --> 02:18:20,743
Bye.

1855
02:18:24,414 --> 02:18:26,337
Goodbye, Claire.

1856
02:18:32,463 --> 02:18:34,682
All right,
I'd say we've done our part here.

1857
02:18:34,841 --> 02:18:37,469
You know what? Not now.

1858
02:18:43,433 --> 02:18:46,277
He says he's coming, I want people
at Logan, South Station...

1859
02:18:46,436 --> 02:18:48,814
...downtown, Greyhound,
subway, everything. Now.

1860
02:18:48,980 --> 02:18:51,233
DINO: The city's covered.
FRAWLEY: Good.

1861
02:19:14,005 --> 02:19:16,758
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
We 're secure, and everything 's ready.

1862
02:19:23,014 --> 02:19:26,985
-Sir, we need you to stay off the street.
-Just going to work. No problem.

1863
02:19:43,159 --> 02:19:44,911
-How long?
-Forty minutes.

1864
02:19:45,411 --> 02:19:47,288
-Alleyway clear?
-Yes, sir.

1865
02:20:00,802 --> 02:20:03,897
MAN [OVER RADIO]: We got nothing.
Still no movement in the alley. Over.

1866
02:20:05,264 --> 02:20:08,518
Well, I guess he didn't have as big a thing
for you as you thought.

1867
02:20:10,269 --> 02:20:12,112
I guess not.

1868
02:20:33,918 --> 02:20:35,511
"My sunny days."

1869
02:20:43,094 --> 02:20:45,893
You know, Claire,
we are a national organization.

1870
02:20:53,938 --> 02:20:57,033
All right, boys, let's pack it up.
He ain't coming.

1871
02:20:57,191 --> 02:20:59,660
Let's get the description out.
Let's go.

1872
02:20:59,902 --> 02:21:01,745
We know what he looks like.

1873
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:04,123
Let's go ind him.

1874
02:21:07,743 --> 02:21:08,869
All right. You good?

1875
02:21:09,036 --> 02:21:10,834
Hey, best possible outcome, you know.

1876
02:21:10,997 --> 02:21:12,920
Well done, well done.

1877
02:21:50,703 --> 02:21:52,171
It's for you.

1878
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:00,945
DOUG:
Claire, take this.

1879
02:23:01,232 --> 02:23:03,860
You'll do better with it than I can.

1880
02:23:04,485 --> 02:23:07,079
By the time you read this,
I'll be long gone.

1881
02:23:07,238 --> 02:23:08,535
Not the way I planned it...

1882
02:23:09,031 --> 02:23:13,081
...but for the first time in my life,
l?n leaving this city.

1883
02:23:25,673 --> 02:23:26,720
Maybe if I go...

1884
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:29,427
...I can stop looking.

1885
02:23:51,449 --> 02:23:53,167
No matter how much you change...

1886
02:23:53,326 --> 02:23:56,250
You still have to pay the price
for the things you've done.

1887
02:23:59,415 --> 02:24:01,258
So I got a long road.

1888
02:24:06,922 --> 02:24:09,266
But I know i'll see you again.

1889
02:24:15,097 --> 02:24:17,099
This side or the other.

1890
02:30:27,010 --> 02:30:29,012
